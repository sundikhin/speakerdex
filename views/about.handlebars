				<p>Engineering is broader than writing code or designing a circuit. In reality, nontechnical competencies are just as critical to engineers as their technical training. IEEE-USA student professional awareness activities are oriented to enhance the leadership, career, and professional development skills of engineering students.
				</p>

				<p>Student members of IEEE have many resources available to them - all you have to do is ask. Our regional support coordinators and every member of the committee are committed to helping you get the most out of your SPAx experience.

				<h2>IEEE Student Chapter Involvement</h2>
				<p>The sky is the limit. Student Chapters are encouraged to create their own Student Professional Awareness event, and the experience is yours to decide. Traditional conference format, ventures, techtalks, resume workshops, are just some of the few options you have as students to engage yourselves in professional awareness activies. Learn from our newly revamped experience page, specially created as a platform for student chapters around the world to share their innovation and creative with each other.</p>
				<h3>Get involved today.</h3>

			<p> This year, IEEE-USA is celebrating the 35th birthday of the SPAC program. Since its inception in 1985, Over 100,000 students participated from this effort to encourage students to be more professionally aware. In our continual quest to provide an even better experience and value to the student members of IEEE, a new effort was made to listen and understand the SPAC program from the students perspective, and how IEEE-USA can improve their process to enhance the student experience. We discovered two key lessons</p>

			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<p>In Fall 2014, IEEE-USA announced a new program called Student Professional Awareness Experience. SPAx builds on the longstanding legacy of Student Professional Awareness Conferences and Ventures, in an effort to address the highly dynamic world we live in today. The goal is for students to “Engage. Explore. Experience.”</p>

				<h1>What is X?</h1>
				<p>The “x” in SPAx is a variable. It could be shaped as a conference with an invited expert speaker, a series of activities focused on honing career skills, a social event to foster networking and team building skills, a design contest, a tech talk, or any other format, as long as they focus on one or more of the following eight areas. You decide what works for your chapter, and IEEE gives you the support to implement your ideas.</p>
