# Speakerdex : Final Project

## Overview
Student chapters of the IEEE-USA SPAx program have requested a list of our national speakers so that they can invite renowned speakers to talk at their events. Today, the students have no way of knowing which speakers are available, who might live in the region, or what topics the speakers have in their repertoire. The committee that runs the SPAx program has the list of all this information, but has not found a way to display it previously. The speakerdex will help student chapters filter through speakers by topic and region to find one that fits the theme of the event they are trying to host at their university.

## UI Description
- Home page that gives a quick overview of the program (one or two paragraphs) so that student chapters know that they are on the correct website.
- Speakers page with filters so that students can filter by region/location and topic.
- Speaker page with details of different talks in that speaker's repertoire and a short bio.
- A contact page with information on regional contacts for whom the students can reach out to in order to contact each speaker.

## Key Features
- Only those with an @ieee.org email address can create / log in to access the speakers list.
- Speaker filtering by location and topic
- Six or seven select accounts will be able to add new speakers to the list or delete outdated ones.
